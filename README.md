# üß§ Glove Detection in Manufacturing: Ablation Study on YOLOv8m-seg

## üöÄ Overview
Welcome to the research repository on **glove/no-glove detection** for manufacturing environments, powered by systematic ablation studies of the **YOLOv8m-seg (medium)** segmentation model!

This project investigates how simplifying and modifying YOLOv8m-seg impacts **speed**, **accuracy**, and **deployability** for **real-time PPE compliance** on edge devices.

---

## üèóÔ∏è What‚Äôs Included

- üìö Structured ablation experiments (backbone, neck, segmentation head modifications)
- üìä Performance comparison between baseline and lightweight variants
- ‚ö° Open-source ultra-compact architectures for real-time edge deployment
- üóÇÔ∏è Data splits, evaluation metrics, and training parameters for full reproducibility

---

## ‚ú® Highlights

### Ablation Strategies
- Backbone/neck **depth & channel reduction**
- **SPPF** (Spatial Pyramid Pooling) removal
- Deep (**P5**) feature path pruning
- Minimalist segmentation heads (e.g., **P3-only** mask prediction)

### Optimized for Small Object Detection
- Design targeted at **detecting gloves and hand PPE** on assembly lines

### Ready for Edge Deployment
- Models up to **5√ó smaller and faster**  
  (GFLOPs: 110 ‚Üí as low as 10)
- Evaluated on **Jetson Nano**, **Orin**, and **desktop GPUs**
